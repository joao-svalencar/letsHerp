### **An Interface to the Reptile Database**

This package was developed to facilitate the processes of reptile nomenclature update based on a search for species synonyms according to [The Reptile Database](https://reptile-database.reptarium.cz) website (Uetz et al., 2025).

Currently, the package accesses many species information from the Reptile Database using R interface.

I hope it to be useful to people trying to match databases from different sources (IUCN, species traits database, etc), or trying to get summaries from a given higher taxa or region (e.g.: Snakes from Brazil). But it can also just print single species information directly in R.

Any feedback, suggestion or request are welcome!

### **Download**

A CRAN submission is in progress; until then, the development version can be installed from GitHub.

To install the stable version of this package, users must run:

```{.r}
# Install development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joao-svalencar/letsHerp")

library(letsHerp)
```

### **List of functions and examples**
**Function `herpSearch`:**

Retrieves species information from The Reptile Database using a binomial name.
```{.r}
# single species:
herpSearch(binomial = "Apostolepis adhara")

# If user wants to check the list of references related to species, as listed in RDB:
herpSearch(binomial = "Bothrops pauloensis", ref=TRUE)
```

`herpSearch()` supports synonym-based queries. If the provided binomial does not match any currently valid species name, the function automatically passes the query to `herpAdvancedSearch(synonym = binomial)`. In such cases, if the synonym can be unambiguously resolved to a valid species, the function will return the corresponding species information. Otherwise, it provides a link to a list of all species that include the queried synonym in their synonymy (which can be accessed using `herpSpecies(link)`)

**Function `herpAdvancedSearch`:**

Creates a link for a page as derived from an Advanced Search in RD (multiple species in a page):
```{.r}
# create multiple species link:
link_boa <- herpAdvancedSearch(genus = "Boa") #returns a link to a list of all Boa species

link_apo <- herpAdvancedSearch(genus = "Apostolepis") #returns a link to a list of all Apostolepis species

link <- herpAdvancedSearch(higher = "snakes", location = "Brazil") #returns a link to a list of all snake species in Brazil

link <- herpAdvancedSearch(year = "2010 OR 2011 OR 2012") #returns a link to a list of all species described from 2010 to 2012
```

`herpAdvancedSearch(synonym = "example")` will return the species information directly (via `herpSearch("example")`) if the synonym uniquely matches a single valid species.

**Function `herpSpecies`:**

Retrieve species data from the species link created by `herpAdvancedSearch`. User can also copy and paste the url from a RD webpage containing the list of species derived from an advanced search. It includes higher taxa information, authors, year of description, and the species url. By default this function uses parallel processing, with default set to leave just one core available. **NOTE:** Parallel processing may affect system performance. Adjust the number of cores according to your needs. If user wants to use just one core, there are options for backup saving based on the `checkpoint` argument.

```{.r}
# sample multiple species data:
#Returns higher taxa information and species url:
boa <- herpSpecies(link_boa, taxonomicInfo = TRUE, getLink = TRUE) #link from herpAdvancedSearch(genus = "Boa")

#example 2
apo <- herpSpecies(link_apo, taxonomicInfo = TRUE, getLink = TRUE) #link from herpAdvancedSearch(genus = "Apostolepis")

#Returns only species url - Faster and recommended for large datasets:
boa <- herpSpecies(link_boa, taxonomicInfo = FALSE, getLink = TRUE) #link from herpAdvancedSearch(genus = "Boa")

#example 2
apo <- herpSpecies(link_apo, taxonomicInfo = FALSE, getLink = TRUE) #link from herpAdvancedSearch(genus = "Apostolepis")

#With checkpoint and backups (only without parallel sampling: a lot slower but safer):
path <- "path/to/save/backup_file.rds" #not to run just example 
apo <- herpSpecies(link_apo, taxonomicInfo = FALSE, getLink = TRUE, checkpoint=6, backup_file=path) #link from herpAdvancedSearch(genus = "Apostolepis")
```

⚠️ **Note:**

All console messages, warnings, and progress updates can be silenced. However, `herpSpecies()` issues a helpful warning if any species information fails to be retrieved, along with instructions on how to access those entries from the function output.

**Function `herpSynonyms`:**

Samples species synonyms using a data frame with species names and the species link (e.g.: the result of `herpSpecies(link, getLink=TRUE)`). By default this function uses parallel processing, with default set to leave just one core available. **NOTE:** Parallel processing may affect system performance. Adjust the number of cores according to your needs. If user wants to use just one core, there are options for backup saving based on the `checkpoint` argument.

```{.r}
# sample species synonyms
boa_syn <- herpSynonyms(boa)

#example 2
apo_syn <- herpSynonyms(apo)
```

⚠️ **Note:**

All console messages, warnings, and progress updates can be silenced. However, `herpSynonyms()` issues a helpful warning if any species information fails to be retrieved, along with instructions on how to access those entries from the original data frame.

The complex `regex` pattern used to sample synonyms from The Reptile Database is quite efficient, but still samples about 0.2% in an incorrect format. Most cases represent unusual nomenclature so users might not face any problems trying to match current valid names. In any case, I fixed (potentially) all unusual synonym formats in the internal dataset `allSynonyms` (last update: 23rd May, 2025)

**Function `herpSync`:**

Initially inspired in function aswSync from package [AmphiNom](https://github.com/hcliedtke/AmphiNom) (Liedtke, 2018).

This is the most recursive function of the package, using all the previous functions in order to provide the most likely updated nomenclature for the queried species. The function is divided in two main steps. Here is how it works:

*Step 1*

The function queries a vector of species (e.g.: IUCN, or a regional list), check their validity through `herpSearch` and returns a data frame with current valid species names. When `herpSearch` finds a species page it assumes that is the valid name for the queried species and returns the status "up_to_date". When `herpSearch` doesn't find a species it parses the binomial to `herpAdvancedSearch` using the synonym filter. If `herpAvancedSearch` returns a link for a species page that species name is considered valid for the synonym queried and the function returns the status "updated". Otherwise, `herpAvancedSearch` will return a link for a page with a list of species, then the function assumes that the queried synonym could be assigned to any of those valid names and returns the status: "ambiguous". If the queried species does not return a species page nor a page for multiple species the function returns to column "RDB" the sentence "Not found" and to column "status" the word "unknown".

*Step 2*

Step 2 is activated only if `solveAmbiguity = TRUE`. When `herpAvancedSearch` returns a link for a page with a list of species, that link is parsed to `herpSpecies` which collects species names and `urls` and automatically parses the resulting data frame to `herpSynonyms`. Finally, with the result of `herpSynonyms` the function compares the queried species with all listed synonyms. If the queried species is actually listed as a synonym of only one of the searched species (e.g. the queried name is not a synonym, but is mentioned in the comments section), the function will return that valid name and status will be "updated". If the queried species is actually a synonym of more than one valid species, then the function will return both species names and the status will still be "ambiguous".

```{.r}
# comparing synonyms:
query <- c("Vieira-Alencar authoristicus",
           "Boa atlantica",
           "Boa diviniloqua",
           "Boa imperator",
           "Boa constrictor longicauda")

herpSync(query)

#example 2:
query <- c("Vieira-Alencar authorisensis",
           "Apostolepis ambiniger",
           "Apostolepis cerradoensis",
           "Elapomorphus assimilis",
           "Apostolepis tertulianobeui",
           "Apostolepis goiasensis")

herpSync(query)
```

The column "RDB" shows current valid name according to The Reptile Database.

Special attention is needed to column "status":

**status:**

- "up_to_date" - Species name provided is the current valid name found in The Reptile Database
 
- "updated" - Species name provided is a synonym, and the current valid name is reported unambiguously.

- "ambiguous" - Species name provided is considered a synonym of more than one current valid species, likely from a split in taxonomy.

- "unknown" - Species name provided in query is not a current valid name nor synonym according to The Reptile Database. This status could be derived from a typo within species name. A very rare situation where this status can pop up is when the current valid name is updated in the query but is not found in the list of synonyms.

- "duplicated" - Multiple names in the query are now considered synonyms of a single valid species, likely from a synonymization.

⚠️ **ATTENTION!**⚠️ 

`letsHerp` does not make authoritative taxonomic decisions. It matches input names against currently accepted names in The Reptile Database (RDB). 
A name marked as `"up_to_date"` may still refer to a taxon that has been split, and thus may not reflect the most recent population-level taxonomy.

**Function `herpTidySyn`:**

This function was developed exclusively to improve the visualization of `herpSync` outcome. Queried species with many current valid names would break the data frame visualizarion in the R console. `herpTidySyn` stacks current valid names and improves data visualization. Moreover, the argument `filter`, allows users to filter the printed data frame by "status" so users can focus only in the status that they want to evaluate.

```{.r}
query <- c("Vieira-Alencar authorisensis",
           "Apostolepis ambiniger",
           "Apostolepis cerradoensis",
           "Elapomorphus assimilis",
           "Apostolepis tertulianobeui",
           "Apostolepis goiasensis")

df <- herpSync(query)
herpTidySyn(df)
```
